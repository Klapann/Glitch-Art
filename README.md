# Glitch-Art
The artwork created from my glitching with Audacity and Pixel Sorting 

This was my all time favorite assignment from this semester. I really enjoyed figuring out to make these images into something else with glitching, I juts think it's really cool that I did that to these pictures. For this project I crunched it in the night before but it was the most productive I've ever felt about any of our coding assignments, everything just made sense and everything that turned out I was really proud of. It was awesome to open the file I had created and see something that I was genuinely impressed by, it felt nice considering I barely felt accomplished in my other code early on.
